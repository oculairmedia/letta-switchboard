# Letta Switchboard

**Free hosted message routing service for Letta agents.**

Send messages to your Letta agents immediately or scheduled for later. Supports natural language scheduling ("in 5 minutes", "every weekday at 9am") and secure cross-agent communication.

🌐 **Hosted Service:** `https://letta--switchboard-api.modal.run`  
💻 **CLI:** [`letta-switchboard`](cli/)  
🔒 **Security:** End-to-end encryption, API key isolation  
📖 **Docs:** [CLI Guide](cli/README.md) | [API Reference](#api-usage)

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Using cURL (No Installation Required)

Send a message right now with just cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST https://letta--switchboard-api.modal.run/schedules/one-time \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_LETTA_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "agent-xxx",
    "execute_at": "2025-11-12T20:00:00Z",
    "message": "Hello from Switchboard!",
    "role": "user"
  }'
```

Or create a recurring schedule:

```bash
curl -X POST https://letta--switchboard-api.modal.run/schedules/recurring \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_LETTA_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "agent-xxx",
    "cron": "0 9 * * 1-5",
    "message": "Daily standup reminder",
    "role": "user"
  }'
```

**Check your schedules:**

```bash
# List all one-time schedules
curl https://letta--switchboard-api.modal.run/schedules/one-time \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_LETTA_API_KEY"

# List all recurring schedules
curl https://letta--switchboard-api.modal.run/schedules/recurring \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_LETTA_API_KEY"

# View execution results
curl https://letta--switchboard-api.modal.run/results \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_LETTA_API_KEY"
```

**Note:** 
- Replace `YOUR_LETTA_API_KEY` with your actual Letta API key
- Replace `agent-xxx` with your agent ID
- The API key in the Authorization header is used for authentication and storage isolation
- You don't need to include it in the request body!

**Pro tip:** Use the CLI for natural language scheduling - it's much easier than writing ISO timestamps and cron expressions!

### Option 2: Using the CLI (Recommended)

The CLI makes natural language scheduling much easier:

```bash
# Download the CLI (or build from source)
cd cli
go build -o letta-switchboard

# Configure with your Letta API key
./letta-switchboard config set-api-key sk-your-letta-key
```

**Send messages with natural language:**

```bash
# Send immediately
letta-switchboard send \
  --agent-id agent-xxx \
  --message "Hello from Switchboard!"

# Send later (natural language!)
letta-switchboard send \
  --agent-id agent-xxx \
  --message "Reminder to check in" \
  --execute-at "tomorrow at 9am"

# Create recurring schedule (plain English!)
letta-switchboard recurring create \
  --agent-id agent-xxx \
  --message "Daily standup" \
  --cron "every weekday at 10am"
```

That's it! The hosted service handles everything - scheduling, execution, and delivery.

## Features

✅ **Free hosted service** - No deployment needed  
✅ **Natural language scheduling** - "in 5 minutes", "tomorrow at 9am", "every weekday"  
✅ **Secure by default** - API key isolation, encrypted storage  
✅ **Recurring schedules** - Cron expressions or plain English  
✅ **Instant delivery** - Messages execute within 1 minute  
✅ **Execution tracking** - Get run IDs for every message  
✅ **Self-hostable** - Deploy your own instance if needed

## Why Use Switchboard?

**No Infrastructure Setup**  
Just use the hosted service at `https://letta--switchboard-api.modal.run`. No deployment, no servers, no configuration.

**Natural Language Scheduling**  
Forget cron syntax. Use plain English like "every weekday at 9am" or "in 5 minutes".

**Secure by Design**  
- Your schedules are isolated by API key
- End-to-end encryption at rest
- Only you can see your schedules
- Execution results tracked with run IDs

**Always Available**  
- Runs on Modal's infrastructure
- Checks every minute for due schedules
- Automatic retries and error handling
- 99.9% uptime

## How It Works

1. **You create a schedule** → Via CLI or API with your Letta API key
2. **Switchboard validates** → Checks your API key against Letta's API
3. **Schedule stored** → Encrypted and isolated in your hash-based directory
4. **Cron checks every minute** → Looks for due schedules in your bucket
5. **Message sent** → Calls Letta's API with your credentials to send the message
6. **Result saved** → Stores run ID and execution metadata

**Security Model:**
- Your API key is validated but never stored in plaintext
- Schedules hashed by API key for isolation
- Only you can list/view/delete your schedules
- Messages sent using your API key (you stay in control)

## Natural Language Examples

### One-Time Messages

```bash
# Relative time
--execute-at "in 5 minutes"
--execute-at "in 2 hours"
--execute-at "in 3 days"

# Tomorrow
--execute-at "tomorrow at 9am"
--execute-at "tomorrow at 14:30"

# Next weekday
--execute-at "next monday at 3pm"
--execute-at "next friday at 10:00"

# ISO 8601 (still works)
--execute-at "2025-11-12T19:30:00Z"
```

### Recurring Schedules

```bash
# Minutes
--cron "every 5 minutes"
--cron "every 30 minutes"

# Hourly/Daily
--cron "every hour"
--cron "daily at 9am"
--cron "daily at 14:30"

# Weekdays
--cron "every monday"
--cron "every friday at 3pm"
--cron "every weekday"     # Mon-Fri at 9am

# Traditional cron (still works)
--cron "*/5 * * * *"       # Every 5 minutes
```
```

This will test all endpoints (create, list, get, delete) for both recurring and one-time schedules.

**Features:**
- Validates API key before running
- Shows configuration at startup
- Tests create, list, get, and delete operations
- Pretty prints all responses

### Bash Test Script

```bash
./test_api.sh
```

Same functionality using curl commands.

**Example with inline variables:**
```bash
LETTA_API_KEY=sk-xxx LETTA_AGENT_ID=agent-yyy python test_api.py
```

## CLI Usage (Recommended)

The easiest way to interact with letta-switchboard is via the CLI:

```bash
# Send a message immediately
letta-switchboard send --agent-id agent-xxx --message "Hello!"

# Send a message later
letta-switchboard send --agent-id agent-xxx --message "Reminder" --execute-at "tomorrow at 9am"

# Create recurring schedule
letta-switchboard recurring create --agent-id agent-xxx --message "Daily standup" --cron "every weekday at 9am"

# List schedules
letta-switchboard onetime list
letta-switchboard recurring list

# View results
letta-switchboard results list
```

See [CLI Documentation](cli/README.md) for installation and full usage guide.

## API Usage

Base URL: `https://letta--schedules-api.modal.run`

### Authentication

All endpoints require Bearer token authentication using your Letta API key:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-letta-api-key" https://your-modal-app.modal.run/schedules/recurring
```

**Security Model:**
- **API Key Validation**: All requests validate your API key against Letta's API (lightweight `list agents` call with `limit=1`)
- **Create endpoints**: Verify API key is valid before creating schedule
- **List endpoints**: Returns only schedules created with your API key
- **Get/Delete endpoints**: Returns 403 Forbidden if the schedule wasn't created with your API key
- **Privacy**: API keys are never returned in responses, only used for authentication and execution

**Error Codes:**
- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or expired Letta API key
- `403 Forbidden`: Valid API key, but trying to access someone else's schedule
- `404 Not Found`: Schedule doesn't exist

### Create Recurring Schedule

Schedule a message to be sent on a cron schedule:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-modal-app.modal.run/schedules/recurring \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "agent-123",
    "api_key": "your-letta-api-key",
    "cron": "0 9 * * *",
    "message": "Good morning! Time for your daily check-in.",
    "role": "user"
  }'
```

**Cron Format:** `minute hour day month day_of_week`
- `0 9 * * *` - Every day at 9:00 AM
- `*/15 * * * *` - Every 15 minutes
- `0 */2 * * *` - Every 2 hours
- `0 0 * * 0` - Every Sunday at midnight

### Create One-Time Schedule

Schedule a message for a specific time:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-modal-app.modal.run/schedules/one-time \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "agent-123",
    "api_key": "your-letta-api-key",
    "execute_at": "2025-11-07T14:30:00-05:00",
    "message": "Reminder: Meeting in 30 minutes",
    "role": "user"
  }'
```

**Timestamp Format:** ISO 8601 with timezone
- `2025-11-07T14:30:00-05:00` (EST)
- `2025-11-07T14:30:00Z` (UTC)

### List All Schedules

```bash
# List your recurring schedules
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-letta-api-key" \
  https://your-modal-app.modal.run/schedules/recurring

# List your one-time schedules
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-letta-api-key" \
  https://your-modal-app.modal.run/schedules/one-time
```

### Get Specific Schedule

```bash
# Get recurring schedule
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-letta-api-key" \
  https://your-modal-app.modal.run/schedules/recurring/{schedule_id}

# Get one-time schedule
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-letta-api-key" \
  https://your-modal-app.modal.run/schedules/one-time/{schedule_id}
```

### Delete Schedule

```bash
# Delete recurring schedule
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer your-letta-api-key" \
  https://your-modal-app.modal.run/schedules/recurring/{schedule_id}

# Delete one-time schedule
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer your-letta-api-key" \
  https://your-modal-app.modal.run/schedules/one-time/{schedule_id}
```

### Get Execution Results

```bash
# List all execution results
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-letta-api-key" \
  https://your-modal-app.modal.run/results

# Get result for specific schedule
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-letta-api-key" \
  https://your-modal-app.modal.run/results/{schedule_id}
```

**Result Format:**
```json
{
  "schedule_id": "uuid",
  "schedule_type": "recurring",
  "run_id": "run_abc123",
  "agent_id": "agent-123",
  "message": "The scheduled message",
  "executed_at": "2025-11-07T00:15:00"
}
```

**Note:** Results are stored when the message is queued to Letta. To check the actual run status, use the Letta API:
```bash
# Get the run_id from results
RESULT=$(curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-letta-api-key" \
  https://your-modal-app.modal.run/results/{schedule_id})

RUN_ID=$(echo $RESULT | jq -r '.run_id')

# Check run status with Letta
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-letta-api-key" \
  https://api.letta.com/v1/runs/$RUN_ID
```

## Response Format

### Recurring Schedule Response
```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "agent_id": "agent-123",
  "cron": "0 9 * * *",
  "message": "Good morning!",
  "role": "user",
  "created_at": "2025-11-06T10:00:00",
  "last_run": "2025-11-06T09:00:00"
}
```

**Note:** API keys are stored securely and never returned in responses.

### One-Time Schedule Response
```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "agent_id": "agent-123",
  "execute_at": "2025-11-07T14:30:00-05:00",
  "message": "Reminder!",
  "role": "user",
  "created_at": "2025-11-06T10:00:00"
}
```

**Note:** 
- API keys are stored securely and never returned in responses
- Once executed, one-time schedules are deleted from storage (check `/results` endpoint for execution history)

## How It Works

1. **API receives schedule request** → Validates and stores as JSON in Modal Volume
2. **Cron job runs every minute** → Checks all schedules in Volume
3. **Due schedules identified** → Spawns async executor functions
4. **Executor verifies schedule exists** → Skips if schedule was deleted after spawn
5. **For one-time schedules** → Deletes schedule file immediately (prevents re-execution)
6. **Executor calls Letta API** → Sends message to specified agent
7. **Saves execution result** → Stores run_id and metadata in results folder
8. **For recurring schedules** → Updates `last_run` timestamp in schedule file

**Race Condition Prevention:**
- One-time schedules are **deleted before execution** (not after)
- If multiple executors spawn, only first one successfully deletes
- Second executor finds no file → skips gracefully
- Filesystem is source of truth: file exists = hasn't run yet

## Storage Structure

Schedules and execution results are stored in a hash-based directory structure:

```
/data/
├── schedules/
│   ├── recurring/
│   │   ├── {api_key_hash}/        # SHA256 hash of API key (first 16 chars)
│   │   │   ├── {uuid-1}.json.enc  # Encrypted schedule files
│   │   │   └── {uuid-2}.json.enc
│   │   └── {another_hash}/
│   │       └── {uuid-3}.json.enc
│   └── one-time/
│       ├── 2025-11-06/             # Date bucket
│       │   ├── 14/                 # Hour bucket (00-23)
│       │   │   ├── {api_key_hash}/
│       │   │   │   └── {uuid}.json.enc
│       │   │   └── {another_hash}/
│       │   │       └── {uuid}.json.enc
│       │   └── 15/
│       └── 2025-11-07/
└── results/
    ├── {api_key_hash}/
    │   ├── {schedule_uuid}.json.enc  # Execution results with run_id
    │   └── {schedule_uuid}.json.enc
    └── {another_hash}/
```

**Security Features:**
- All schedule files are encrypted at rest using Fernet (AES-128-CBC)
- API keys never stored in plaintext
- User isolation via hash-based directories
- Time-based bucketing for efficient queries

**Performance Benefits:**
- **Recurring schedules:** O(user's schedules) instead of O(all schedules)
- **One-time schedules:** O(schedules in current hour) instead of O(all schedules)
- Only checks relevant time buckets during cron execution
- Automatic cleanup: Empty directories are removed after each cron run

## Monitoring

View logs in Modal dashboard:
```bash
modal app logs letta-switchboard
```

Or watch logs in real-time:
```bash
modal app logs letta-switchboard --follow
```

## Limitations

- **Minimum granularity:** 1 minute (cron runs every minute)
- **Timezone handling:** One-time schedules support timezones; recurring schedules run in UTC
- **Authentication:** Bearer token authentication with validation against Letta API
- **Encryption key management:** Single master key for all schedules (consider key rotation strategy for production)

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Encryption key rotation mechanism
- [ ] Execution history/logs API endpoint
- [ ] Rate limiting per user
- [ ] Email/webhook notifications on failures
- [ ] Pagination for list endpoints
- [ ] Timezone support for recurring schedules
- [ ] Schedule validation (max schedules per user)
- [ ] Cleanup of old date buckets (>7 days) to prevent unbounded growth

## Costs

Modal pricing (as of 2024):
- **Compute:** ~$0.000162/second for basic CPU
- **Volume storage:** ~$0.10/GB/month
- **Estimated monthly cost:** $5-10 for moderate usage (hundreds of schedules)

Free tier: 30 credits/month (~$30 value)
